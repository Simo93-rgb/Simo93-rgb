# Hi, I'm Simone! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Eastern Piedmont, with a strong foundation in Computer Science. My goal is to build intelligent systems, tackling complex challenges to turn data into practical, high-value solutions.

ðŸŒ± My core interests and work areas include:

* **Machine & Deep Learning:** Developing and training models for classification, regression, and clustering problems. 
* **Computer Vision:** Experienced with object detection using YOLO. 
* **Data Science:** Analyzing and manipulating complex datasets using Python and its core libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) to extract meaningful insights.

ðŸ¦€ I'm currently diving into:
I'm applying **Transformer architectures** to the medical domain as part of my master's thesis, with a focus on **Explainable AI (XAI)** to uncover why certain patients experience delays during the discharge process.
